<p>After mentally cursing out New York City drivers, I made the 4 minute trek from my apartment to Fractal&#39;s AI Accelerator in Williamsburg.</p>
<p>I arrived around 8:15am. A benefit of arriving so early was that I got a chance to speak with Andrew for an extended amount of time.</p>
<p>I mentioned that the night before, I stopped by Fractal and spoke with some of the students during a Sunday community event.  I highlighted that I was extremely cynical: the more I read about AI modifying the tech landscape, the more doom I read and felt from industry leaders and veterans. </p>
<p>I was left unconvinced because I believed AI-driven engineering encourages speed over understanding, and abstracting away from the code layer encourages &quot;systems-level&quot; engineering - but what informs everyone&#39;s &quot;systems&quot; is different or guided by their intuition / gut. What happens when these all clash? Where does the line between a product person and an engineering person start or end?</p>
<p>Anyways, these are all questions I am still thinking about. Paris, one of the instructors who is leaving for OpenAI the next week (bummer, was looking forward to learning from him) highlighted one interesting analogies, among others:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the tablesaw was introduced, the field of carpentry shifted from &quot;how do we cut the wood&quot; more towards &quot;what can we build now that we have so much wood to cut with&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>The Fractal instructors were confident to look at, and embrace, that these changes. Indeed the era of manually writing coding, at depth, is dead. However, this abstraction should open up much more opportunities for those who embrace - those who wouldn&#39;t keep up would be left behind. At least, that&#39;s the takeway.</p>
<p>I also had another conversation with Andrew about Claude-driven learning, which I found interesting. Say for a class of 30 people (in whatever discipline), each student has to pass an objective bar that is the same for all members of the group. For example, passing a test with a high enough.</p>
<p>With Claude, a cohort of 30 people can each receive personalized instruction tailored to their individual needs and pace. Meanwhile, the instructor can still track objective progress across the entire cohort, all without forcing everyone to meet identical milestones or learn the same way. This is a pretty interesting way to scale individualized learning, and something I hope to learn more progress about.</p>
<p>Aside from these conversations, we had some other tasks. The main responsibility was to create a portfolio website, something not too difficult. </p>
<p>This was my first time using Claude Code, and I ended up hacking together a CMS. In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>I use Obsidian to create / edit articles</li>
<li>I store them on iCloud</li>
<li>I run a build function Claude made to publish them using CloudFlare Pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, all I have to do is write in Obsidian, push to my github repo, and my blog is set! </p>
<p>Lastly, we did a lot of intros and personal journaling. 
I&#39;m not particularly a fan of <em>written</em> journaling, so I was a bit ambivalent about these exercises. 
I was also rather tired because I didn&#39;t get much sleep the night before.</p>
<p>During intros, everyone came from an amazing background. We had experienced software engineers, product managers, a physician, recent CS grads wanting more out of their field than another &quot;job&quot;, a music teacher, etc..</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t have much to discuss about myself, but I am fine with this. A goal of mine is to not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feel any need to signal I&#39;m interesting</li>
<li>Be afraid of looking stupid, saying &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; or coming across as ordinary</li>
<li>Pretend to be anything I&#39;m not to fit in</li>
</ul>
<p>Not always easy, but it was a good first day to settle in.</p>
