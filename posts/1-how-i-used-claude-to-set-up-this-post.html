                <p>Previously, my old website was situated at <a href="https://fs29.webflow.io">https://fs29.webflow.io</a>.</p>
<p>This is a site I have handcrafted and used for <em>years</em> - inspired by this site <a href="https://gregkohn.com/">https://gregkohn.com/</a>, a person whose interview I once failed for a technical JavaScript interview!</p>
<p>Webflow, for me, is too expensive. My site is barebones, namely some short articles and previously job and work descriptions. For me, enabling this on Webflow would cost me $276 a year, or $29 a month. This is a problem - I am cheap. </p>
<p>For years I simply used a simple redirect, directing all traffic from this site to webflow&#39;s custom domain. Instead, I decided to undo this laziness by building a proprietary version in 3 hours.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, I spent the first day at <a href="https://fractalbootcamp.com/">Fractal</a>, a NYC-based accelerator for software engineers looking to upscale their artificial intelligence background, on rapidly iterating on this.</p>
<p>After Andrew detailed a cursory, yet effective, explanation to embrace diving deep into Claude Code, I jumped in. Before, I was copy pasting entire code files into Claude, demanding its agency as I sat by in a lazy stupor.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I did much of the same, but less copy-pasting instead <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup">using Claude within the terminal</a>. This is still a learning journey for me, but I was aghast learning just how <em>long</em> I had been doing this the wrong way by using Claude&#39;s native app to copy-paste production-critical software. Being in a space of 25+ other developers, this knowledge transfer took mere seconds (another thing I love about being here in the short time so far!)</p>
<p>I decided to try an interesting approach. Where will I create, edit, and store my blog posts?</p>
<p>I ended up coming up with a unique idea. I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Obsidian (which I am currently editing in) to write my posts</li>
<li>Use my iCloud drive as the source of my Obsidian vault / where all my articles would be stored</li>
<li>Use Claude to create a build script that would take the latest version of all my posts in my Obsidian vault, convert them to static HTML pages, and serve them to the client.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result?</p>
<p>I have an even more robust, cloud-powered CMS where I&#39;m in control of the data to achieve the exact same functionality as my Webflow site.</p>
<p>I deployed my site to my domain (which is hosted on Cloudflare Pages), thus taking the total cost down to $0 (except for the one-time cost of my domain).</p>
<p>This was all done through Claude in a couple of hours. Truly awesome to automate this all so quickly, and only just scratching the surface.</p>
