<p>Today I thought a lot about the direction I want to take my description of this adventure. </p>
<p>I realized that the most <em>relevant</em> part of blogging this experience is probably the technical details of what I&#39;ve learned, especially as it relates to AI-driven development and AI-driven personal education in development.</p>
<p>However, if I was someone wanting to do this program, I am <em>more</em> interested in learning from their <strong>experience</strong> in the program, rather than describing a set of concrete technical skills or a series of tutorials. After all - a prospective student most likely won&#39;t understand these.</p>
<p>I want to make my documentation as human as possible, so I will mention some technical details as I find relevant.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement multiplayer for games of tic-tac-toe. This involves creating a central lobby where you can create new games and view all games, and clicking a game will move you into the page for that new game.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Implement Test Driven Development <em>before</em> implementing server and client logic</p>
</li>
<li><p>Begin practicing System Design to better consider and explain my understanding of web and server architecture in more depth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technical Lessons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>I am very impulsive about diving into the implementation. I did not write tests, I raced straight into finishing the solution. </p>
</li>
<li><p>This led to a multi-hour session of alternating between the client and server, constantly breaking things in both places and debugging problems <em>as they arose</em>, rather than carefully planning in advance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I needed some AI-driven assistance with achieving better code coverage, which is frustrating because Claude handled code-coverage  much better than I could have on my own. At the same time, lots of Claude&#39;s code coverage came from my solution already fully working on its own, so it was basically repeating my own logic back to me in test coverage</p>
</li>
<li><p>I should zero in on the server-side API implementation and wider testing first, before moving back to the client to introduce those routes. I wanted to be done faster (and may have achieved this), but this constant flipping back and forth is not scalable for engineering teams.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Non-technical Lessons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Andrew shared <a href="https://www.readmimir.com/immersive-reader?name=There%E2%80%99s+no+speed+limit&hostedDocId=0a9565bc-aa6c-49ec-91ca-4297ce38abb4&returnSharedCanvas=78247e41-9f07-4a23-91ca-637d9de89854&returnMode=view">this platform with us</a> to highlight a new platform some developers made in Fractal Tech&#39;s co-working area. He highlighted <a href="https://sive.rs/kimo">this article </a>centered around a well-known developer (Derek Siver) and hsi experience bypassing traditional Berklee College of Music degree program by receiving a mentor who greatly accelerated his own individual learning, allowing Derek to graduate much earlier. I enjoyed this read. </li>
<li>Notable quote:<ul>
<li>*Kimo&#39;s high expectations set a new pace for me. He taught me that &quot; <strong>the standard pace is for chumps</strong> &quot; — that the system is designed so anyone can keep up. <strong>If you&#39;re more driven than most people, you can do way more than anyone expects.</strong> And this principle applies to all of life, not just school.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I was quick to agree with the article, before realizing I didn&#39;t consider all perspectives more deeply. For example: <ul>
<li>Are there any tradeoffs to such fast pacing? </li>
<li>Is this truly representative of how other people can learn? Andrew mentioned the <em>mentor</em> set the pace for the student - is the key to succeeding so quickly actually having a mentor who sets the pace and lays out your learning for you?</li>
<li>Another student mentioned this - Wouldn&#39;t anyone in a hyper-individualized mentor-mentee relationship see accelerated results? After all, Derek&#39;s education was so accelerated because it entirely centered around <em>him,</em> rather than a traditional cohort where a professor or educator has to pull up everyone. This raises into questions his claim of &quot;<strong>If you’re more driven than most people, you can do way more than anyone expects.</strong>&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hearing my classmates - who ask such thoughtful and curious questions - really inspires me to step my game up and be even more curious than before. Honestly, I&#39;m becoming more alert and attentive.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notable Moments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>None besides what I&#39;ve mentioned</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;ve been realizing I&#39;ve been starting to mirror the way other people speak, and I&#39;ve been copying speech patterns to fit in. For example, Paris, who is leaving for OpenAI next week, speaks quickly, coherently, and can articulate specific and convoluted ideas while being as succinct as possible. <ul>
<li><em>I don&#39;t&#39; need to do this or be like this</em></li>
<li>I believe I started copying these exact mannerisms, but in writing this, I am reminding myself this is not me. I do not want to adopt the mannerisms of a group or it&#39;s perceived leaders and I hope to maintain my voice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I do hesitate to speak because I wonder if I might say something <em>wrong,</em> especially in a setting of your peers. But in reality...<strong>who cares</strong>?</li>
<li>Most of my learning so far is non-technical. Instead, I need to unlearn my impulsiveness and be more patient, focus on being more intentional and organized in planning <em>before</em> building, and not compare my progress to anyone else&#39;s.</li>
</ul>
