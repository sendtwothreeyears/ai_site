                <p>I realize I should probably standardize the reading experience, so I have included some sections.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong>
Today&#39;s tasks centered on adding server-side persistence to a Tic-Tac-Toe. Admittedly, solving this has been something I have already done with engineering experience, so I did not take it as seriously as I should have because it fit well within my comfort range.</p>
<p>Much of today&#39;s tasks were introductory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning and understanding basic CSS</li>
<li>A brief dive into TailwindCSS</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technical Lessons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Learning about costs of passing too much state around. <ul>
<li>For example, if board state is persisted on the client, that lends itself vulnerable to attack (ex. a rogue Google Chrome extension), or manipulation. </li>
<li>Instead, storing the data on the server both minimizes the request payload (which helps with scaling to millions/billions of requests and save money) and deters malicious actors.</li>
<li>Only store the minimum amount of state you need passed around. In this case, all the client needs is to send the position to the server</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Non-Technical Lessons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>I spoke with Jon, a fellow classmate and doctor. I shared some of my old work on Kasa before. He suggested an interesting approach - just reach out and ask companies for the internship directly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Fractal program requires us to do &quot;internships&quot; with companies, some of which are paid, some of which aren&#39;t.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In my head, &quot;internship&quot; was a term that only applied to college students. I had to realize I was too constrained in my thinking about the word &quot;internship,&quot; and I could instead use the relevant work I had on Kasa to reach out to health tech companies directly. The idea is: &quot;I&#39;ve already worked on some of my own health tech software - here is how I could do the same or similar in a short internship for you.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>It&#39;s so simple, but effective. Fractal usually sets up students with internships. But why wait for an internship when I can just advocate for myself? Will need to update on this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Career Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>I spent a considerable amount of time speaking with Andrew about positioning myself. Prior to Fractal, I spent a considerable amount of time building <a href="https://kasamd.com">Kasa</a> . Not only was my goal to work on something substantive, but to reduce the friction from when I finished Fractal to when I started hunted for an engineering role at a larger company. I don&#39;t want to make a portfolio piece, I want to lead with &quot;real work&quot; and demonstrate tangible value when pitching myself.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Andrew first wondered if I should focus on Kasa instead, rather than some of the introductory assignments if I wasn&#39;t getting the most value out of them. This is really important to consider as the <strong>program builds around your strengths</strong> rather than you following a standardized or traditional path. In Fractal, you set your own personal asymptote. </p>
</li>
<li><p>I expressed that my goal was not to work on Kasa super long-term, but mainly put the best effort into this <em>right now</em> to prepare me to land the next role.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ultimately, Andrew came to the conclusion that he thinks I am able to get the interview, so I should put all of my energy on becoming more hireable rather than improving Kasa to become more functional than it already.  If it does the job in highlighting my strengths / decision-making enough, even if&#39;s not the most advanced, I need to focus on the biggest priority for me career wise, which is working.</p>
</li>
<li><p>He advised I should directly find the type of role I want, and use Claude to work backwards on how to achieve it. Andrew drove the point home that he believed I had the capacity to get to these kinds of roles in &lt;7 weeks (which I&#39;m not so sure about), or make 150-200k. My incredulity probably speaks to a larger lack of confidence. To this end, my reservation was that even if I <em>could</em> get the interview, I was not yet prepared to meet the bar in terms of the Leetcode / system design round. This reservation has held me back. </p>
</li>
<li><p>With Andrew&#39;s encouragement, he affirmed that I should focus on finding the places where I would want to work, feel I am contributing meaningfully, and feel I could create an outsized impact for a company and their mission. All these take precedent <em>before</em> worrying about not being able to meet the interviewing bar. I&#39;ve never thought of removing the interview bar from my mind - if you can&#39;t pass the bar, who cares if you identify with the mission or are a great fit? I will try this new approach.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>I spent about 30 minutes teaching another cohort mate about CSS and how to approach understanding it. I&#39;m not a natural teacher, but it made me affirm my own understanding before explaining it to them. A good lesson is teaching fosters mastery. If you want to perfect something, <strong>get so good at it that you can explain it to someone else who has little to no context.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>It&#39;s Day 3 and about half of the class I barely know them or their names. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s me not being open enough. I believe I am open to everyone but also comfortable to go solo and just focus on my own business. From asking Andrew, it seems like this is a natural evolution from prior cohorts.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Much of today was less about technical concepts or code, and more about challenging my own habits and mental models. It is taking me some rewiring to acknowledge and change that I cut myself from opportunities because I want to look more perfect, or be more exceptionally prepared, than I need to be. <strong>Start with identifying the confidence in your capacities, and then work to identify the skills you need to backfill.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>The book camp so far is not so much powerful because of the technical Rigor put more so the community of people that you surround yourselves with namely people who are incredibly Motivated. Even if I barely know them just by sharing a shared space with them with similar aspirations, motivates me to push harder than I could’ve on my own</p>
</li>
