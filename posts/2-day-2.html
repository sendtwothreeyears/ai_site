                <p>I realize I need to standardize my responses, so I will try today.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>
<p>Create Tic-Tac-Toe</p>
<ul>
<li>I did not find this that challenging and admittedly didn&#39;t try to make it overcomplicated. I finished the problem in about 45 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technical Lessons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Asking better questions about Tic-Tac-Toe</li>
<li>For example, when you consider an &quot;operation,&quot; what are the available options?<ul>
<li>Most people would consider placing a piece an operation on a game board. However, is checking for a winner an operation? </li>
<li>One person contended that an operation is actually something that <em>directly changes the state of the board</em>, while another involves analyzing the state of the board to make a decision.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I really value asking highly-specific questions, and I didn&#39;t consider these. Similar lines of question are improving my ability to think about problems from the simplest, foundational perspectives. These simple questions were simple, yet effective, lessons in more actively considering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle">first principles </a> in all of my decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Non-Technical Lessons</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>None</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This day was low energy for me, as I was still getting adjusted to the move</li>
<li>Most of my learning was not technical, as the material was mostly review. I got more from being around highly qualified and motivated developers, rather than any technical assignment.</li>
